# YamlFixtures

## Overview

A simple abstraction class to use yaml fixtures, instead of PHP classes, on top of DoctrineFixturesBundle.
It also allows the use of particular keywords such as %self% (the reference key of the yaml definition, in case of key => mixed value declaration) or %field% (where "field" refers to a previously defined field).
Finally, this bundle handle One-to-One, Many-to-One and Many-to-Many relations, with the @ prefix.

## Warning

The bundle isn't currently unit tested, use it at your own risks! You might need it to bootstrap your database, but never use it once you are in production mode (this rules is also true for DoctrineFixturesBundle in my opinion).

## Examples

### 1. Keywords usage example

Let's say you have a unique entity User composed of the following fields :
* id : autogenerated it won't be used here
* username
* email

First of all, you have to extends the YamlFixtures class :
    // src/Acme/DemoBundle/DataFixtures/ORM
    <?php
    
    namespace Acme\DemoBundle\DataFixtures\ORM;
    
    use Ck\Component\YamlFixtures\YamlFixture;
    use Acme\DemoBundle\Entity\User;
    
    class LoadUserData extends YamlFixture
    {
        protected function getEntity()
        {
            return new User();
        }
        
        protected function getFilePath()
        {
            return sprintf('%s/../Fixtures/user.yml', __DIR__);
        }
        
        protected function getReferencePrefix()
        {
            return 'user';
        }
        
        public function getOrder()
        {
            return 1;
        }
    }

Now, we'll need some yaml fixtures :

    # src/Acme/DemoBundle/DataFixtures/Fixtures/users.yml
    foo:
        username: alex-ception
        email: alexandre@creakiwi.com
    hubert:
        username: %self% # aka "hubert"
        email: hubert@creakiwi.com
    bar:
        username: bar@example.com
        email: %username% # aka "bar@example.com"
    "baz@example.com":
        username: %self%
        email: %self% # or %username% in this case is also possible
